# Nearby Connect Vision Demo

This repository hosts the **vision demo** for Nearby Connect – a conceptual, illustrative UI showing what the platform experience will feel like once fully implemented. It is **not** the production or alpha codebase. Most dynamic features (real-time nearby discovery, community posts, events, authentication flows, messaging) are mocked or non-functional here.

## Live Alpha Access

The real working alpha (iteratively evolving) is available at:

- [Web Alpha](https://nearbyconnect-v004.vercel.app/)
- [Android App (Play Store)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rawatinnovations.nearbyconnect)
- iOS App: Coming Soon

## What This Demo Shows

- Vision for landing page, feature cards, testimonials
- Conceptual nearby people, events, community board panels (mock data)
- Styling system with Tailwind + shadcn/ui components
- Dark/light theme capability (theming primitives)

## What It Does Not Provide

- Live location-based matching
- Real user accounts or secure auth flows
- Real-time messaging or notifications
- Event creation / community posting back-end
- Map or geospatial visualization

## Purpose

Helps stakeholders, designers, and contributors visualize the direction of the product while core functionality is developed separately.

## Alpha vs Vision Separation

If you're looking to contribute to functional features, work against the active alpha deployed at the links above (different repo/codebase). This vision demo may be periodically refreshed to reflect UI direction only.

## Quick Start (Demo Only)

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Tech Stack

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui
